                <p>All SWAYAM courses are interactive and well designed by expert teachers in their domain in the country. Courses are free of cost for any learner. However, if learner needs certificate then learner has to pay fees for registration for proctored examination. For proctored examination, learner will give proctored exam in-person at designed centres on the specific course examination date. Certificate eligibility is defined in specific course page and certificate will be issued based on defined criteria on course page.</p>
